            <p class="text-gray">For long the world has been focusing on reducing carbon emissions for addressing the
                climate change crisis. There is sufficient evidence now that while this is imperative, the planet needs
                healing and for that restoring ecosystems and nature rejuvenation is imperative. This will not happen
                without water. 

                Most of the disasters caused by climate change are due to water and yet the solution also lies in
                water. 

                Over the past few years the world has seen an increase in area, duration and intensity of drought and
                flood which has led to increased inequality, food insecurity, economic loss and distress migration. To
                bring about mitigation and adaptation and resilience the Peoples World Commission on Drought and Flood (<a
                        href="https://www.pwcdf.org"> www.pwcdf.org</a>) has been formed. The purpose is to bring people
                together and search for solutions. India has tremendous and time tested solutions to offer to the rest
                of the world and within the country itself. The website gives some details of the Commission but it’s
                work in progress.
