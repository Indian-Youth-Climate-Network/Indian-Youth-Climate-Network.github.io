He with his team sorts more than a ton of collected waste every day and send it for recycling, thus saving carbon which would have been otherwise be emitted by waste mismanagement, and production from virgin material. Mansoor does not stop at sorting of waste. ‘He also aims to make a scrap dealers’ cooperative which will play a role in creating a fair price marketplace, provide access to transparent data and geo-tag scrap dealers as the first point of sale for household waste.[1]’ He wants the countries to pursue the agenda of recycling in their climate action commitments, as opposed to incineration of waste –‘waste to energy’(threat to his and many other green entrepreneurs’ livelihood)  which is currently being proposed as climate solution by many national governments. He is associated with Hasiru Dala, a Bangalore- India, based wastepickers and informal waste workers membership organization. Hasiru Dala is a coalition member of Alliance of Indian Wastepickers.</p>
